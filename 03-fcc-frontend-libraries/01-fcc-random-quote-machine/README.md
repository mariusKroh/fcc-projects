# fccRandomQuoteMachine

My version of the Random Quote Machine Project for Free Code Camp. I didn't use jQuery as it seemed a bit overkill for me + I wanted to focus on enhancing my JS skills first.

##### how it works

- 1. Fetching quotes from external JSON and pushing them to an array.
- 2. Run functions for selecting random highlight colors and getting a random quote. Writing those to the DOM. Populate the twitter button with the current quote.
- 3. If a quote's author is empty add "unknown" as author.

##### possible project ideas / enhancements

- Add the ability to filter for specific authors / time periods etc...
- I can imagine this becoming a recipe app where the user can select what's in their fridge and gets a random recipe based on the available ingredients in return.
- I always wanted to do a yoga workout app which selects a random combination of exercises based on user input.
